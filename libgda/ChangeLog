	* gda-server.c (factory_callback): add all created componentes to
	our private list, and connect to their "destroy" signal, so that we
	can keep track of all components, and terminate when there are no
	more
	(component_destroyed_cb): callback function. When no more components
	exist, emit the LAST_CLIENT_GONE signal

	* gda-row.[ch]: new files

	* gda-parameter.c (free_hash_param): added function body

	* gda-server-recordset.c (impl_Recordset_moveFirst):
	(impl_Recordset_moveNext):
