Installation instructions
=========================

The PHP scripts in this directory are used by the GDA Web provider and
have to be installed on a web server. The location of the scripts will have
to be passed as the PATH argument on the Libgda side when
opening the connection. For example if the scripts are accessible
as: http://example.com/path/to/gda-worker.php then the PATH argument
will have to be "path/to".

These scripts need the PHP engine's SimpleXML extension (which is
usually included when compiling PHP) and the PEAR's MDB2 module
(it's the module which actually opens the connection to the database)
for which the current implementation is provided under the PEAR_MDB2/
directory.

Once the scripts are installed, some configuration needs to be done
in the gda-config.php script.

Note that for better security, this script should not be accessible
from the outside (ie it should be put outside ot the web server's
root directory, and the gda-front.php and gda-worker.php scripts should be
modified to point to its real location).


Note about gda-tester.php
-------------------------
The gda-tester.php script can be executed to diagnose any setup problem,
it reports errors if the MDB2 PEAR of SimpleXML extensions are missing,
and, for each configured connection, tests if it can be opened.

Note that by default the gda-tester.php will _not_ display any
configured connection information, this needs to be enabled in the
script's source. Better yet is to remove that file once not necessary
anymore as it could leak useful information.
