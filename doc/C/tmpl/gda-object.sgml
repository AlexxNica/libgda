<!-- ##### SECTION Title ##### -->
GdaObject

<!-- ##### SECTION Short_Description ##### -->
The base class for many of the library's objects

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
This class defines a common behaviour for most of the objects of this library. As the data dictionary is quite dynamic,
the default way by which GObjects are managed (referenced and unreferenced when not needed anymore using g_object_[un]ref())
is not enough: sometimes this behaviour should be kept, and sometimes an object's destruction should be forced and
all the other reference holders of that object should take appropriate actions and drop their reference on that object.
</para>
<para>
Just an example to illustrate this: suppose a data type has been removed from the database itself, 
then the corresponding #GdaDictType must be destroyed since it does not represent a valid data type anymore.
#GdaDictType object are all managed by a #GdaDict which has a reference on them.

When the #GdaDict object does a metadata sychronization (using gda_dict_update_dbms_data()), it calls
gda_object_destroy() on the proper #GdaDictType which must be destroyed. The other objects which did use
tha particular #GdaDictType object (such as #GdaDictField and  #GdaDictFunction for example) catch the
"destroy" signal which is emitted by the #GdaDictType object being destroyed and take appropriate actions
(in this case both these objects will destroy themselves and release any reference they had on the
#GdaDictType object). 

The reference count of the #GdaDictType object being destroyed then should normally reach 0 and the
destruction occur as for any other #GObject object.

<para>
This class also introduces common attributes that can be exploited by the classes inheriting that class, such as:
<itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
         <para>The #GdaDict object to which any #GdaObject relates</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
         <para>The string ID of the object: any string which uniquely identifies a #GdaObject within a dictionary</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
         <para>The ID as a guint, the name, description and owner attached to the #GdaObject.</para>
    </listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>
