<!-- ##### SECTION Short_Description ##### -->
Common functions for GDA clients and providers

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
The gda-common library is used by both GDA clients and providers. Thus,
it contains lots of useful code for both of them, as well as some layers
to hide the underlying technologies (CORBA, configuration database) to
GDA application developers.
</para>
<para>
It also contains some useful stuff that is used internally in other GDA
parts, but that you can also use in your programs.
