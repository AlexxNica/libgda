        The GDA common library contains a set of functions which hide the low-level
        implementation details, apart from offering convenience functions for some
        tasks. The reason for hiding the low-level implementation details is to
        allow an easy porting of the whole libgda architecture by only really porting
        one library, in this case <programname>libgda-common</programname>.
