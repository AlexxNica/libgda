This directory contains information to build a MacOSX bundle after having compiled and
installed Libgda and the GdaBrowser tool.

The prerequisites are to have installed GTK+ and associated libraries and
files using the instructions from http://gtk-osx.sourceforge.net
and specifically the BUILD (http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/gtk-osx/wiki/Build) and
BUNDLE (http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/gtk-osx/wiki/Bundle) pages.

Follow these steps to create a bundle (GdaBrowser.app) on the desktop (~/Desktop):
- set the PREFIX environment variable to the location where Libgda has been installed (the same
  as the --prefix option passed to the configure script)
- from this directory, run:
  ige-mac-bundler gda-browser.bundle
