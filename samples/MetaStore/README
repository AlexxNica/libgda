Libgda simple example
=====================

Description:
------------

The example in this directory illustrate how to get meta data information (information about
the database's objects), and specifically the columns of some tables.

The following is done:
* display columns of the 'customers' table, there should be none as the meta data has not been
  yet updated
* update the meta data for the 'customers' table, and show the columns now
* update the meta data for all the tables, and this time show the columns of the 'products' table

Compiling and running:
----------------------

To compile (make sure Libgda is installed prior to this):
> make

and to run:
> ./example

Output:
