The program xmlquery can be used to test the library:

xmlquery (x|s) (i|u|d|s|r) [filename]

first arg:
 x output in XML format
 s output in SQL format


second arg:
 i construct query (insert) with API calls
 u construct query (update) with API calls
 d construct query (delete) with API calls
 s construct query (select) with API calls
 r read query in XML format from file

note:

xmlquery x r filename is a rather expensive form of
cat filename
